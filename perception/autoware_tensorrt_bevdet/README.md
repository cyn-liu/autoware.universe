# tensorrt_bevdet

## Purpose

tensorrt_bevdet is a dynamic 3D bev object detection package based on 6 surround view cameras.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

BEVDet is a BEV perception algorithm based on panoramic cameras. It unifies multi-view images into the perspective of BEV for 3D object detection task. In this implementation, BEVDet network to inference with TensorRT.

## Limittation

The model is trained on open-source dataset `NuScenes` and has poor generalization on its own dataset, If you want to use this model to infer your data, you need to retrain it.

## Trained Models

The model was trained in NuScenes database for 20 epochs.

If you want to train model using the [TIER IV's internal database(~2600 key frames)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UaarK88HZu09sf7Ix-bEVl9zGNGFwTVL/view?usp=sharing), please refer to the following repositories:[BEVDet adapted to TIER IV dataset](https://github.com/cyn-liu/BEVDet/tree/train_export)
